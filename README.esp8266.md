### 🌧️ Rain Gauge Modification & Calibration
The rain gauge mechanism is a modified version of the [SS4H-RG Rain Gauge Project by SmartSolutions4Home](https://smartsolutions4home.com/ss4h-rg-rain-gauge/).
- **Sensitivity Modifications**: The funnel surface area was enlarged to capture a higher volume of rainfall, significantly increasing sensor sensitivity. In addition, **2 magnets** were inserted into the tipping bucket for precise pulse triggering.
- **Calibration Procedure**:
  - You can refer to the calibration instructions in the original SS4H-RG project, or calibrate manually using water volume:
  1. Slowly pour exactly **6 ml of water** into one side of the tipping bucket.
  2. Turn the adjustment screw beneath that side until the bucket tips and drains the water.
  3. Repeat the exact same step for the opposite side of the bucket to ensure balanced tipping on both sides.

---

### ⚙️ Ball Bearing Degreasing & Lubrication (608Z Bearings)
To ensure the anemometer (wind speed) and wind vane (wind direction) turn freely even in light breezes, factory grease must be removed from the 608Z ball bearings:
1. **Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) Bath**: Soak the bearings in Isopropyl Alcohol for **15 minutes**. Shake them, drain, and repeat with a fresh IPA bath for another **15 minutes** (2 cycles of 15 minutes total). Soaking twice for 15 minutes flushes out all heavy packing grease for optimal results.
2. **Lubrication**: Once dry and degreased, apply a few drops of light oil—such as **gun oil** or **sewing machine oil**—for ultra-low-friction rotation.

---

### 🛠️ Mechanical Assembly & Mounting Notes
- **Sensor Support Arms**: The arms holding the sensor housings must be press-fitted into the main pole mounting base with firm pressure. Use a **rubber mallet** to gently tap them into place if needed.
- **Pole Mount Diameter**: The mounting base is designed to fit standard **3/4-inch galvanized steel pipes** (tubi zincati da 3/4").
- **M8 Thread Retapping**: The M8 screw threads on the pole mount base should be chased/retapped using an **M8 thread tap tool**. Retapping cleans up the 3D-printed threads so M8 clamping bolts can be easily threaded in and tightened securely against the metal pipe, preventing the base from twisting or slipping in strong winds.
- **Counterweight**: It should be inserted inside the tip of the vane. This will prevent it from swinging too much. You can insert any weight you have available or find the weights in the BOM.

## 🔌 Wiring & Pinout

### 📊 Full Schematic Wiring Diagram

Below is the recommended pin mapping for the ESP8266 NodeMCU board:

```
                  ┌──────────────────────┐
                  │   ESP8266 NodeMCU    │
                  ├──────────────────────┤
        (SDA)  D2 ┤ GPIO 4        GPIO 5 ├ D1  (SCL)
    (Rain ISR) D5 ┤ GPIO 14       GPIO 0 ├ D3  (FLASH Button - Factory Reset)
    (Wind ISR) D6 ┤ GPIO 12       GPIO 2 ├ D4  (Status LED)
                  └──────────────────────┘
```

### I2C Bus Connection (Shared SDA / SCL Pins)

Connect the **SDA** and **SCL** pins of all I2C sensors in parallel to the ESP8266:

| Sensor | Sensor VCC | Sensor GND | SDA Pin | SCL Pin | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AHT20 / AHT21** | 3.3V | GND | GPIO 4 (D2) | GPIO 5 (D1) | Address `0x38` |
| **BMP280** | 3.3V | GND | GPIO 4 (D2) | GPIO 5 (D1) | Address `0x76` or `0x77` |
| **ENS160** | 3.3V | GND | GPIO 4 (D2) | GPIO 5 (D1) | Address `0x53` or `0x52` |
| **AS5600** | 3.3V | GND | GPIO 4 (D2) | GPIO 5 (D1) | Address `0x36` |
| **BH1750** | 3.3V | GND | GPIO 4 (D2) | GPIO 5 (D1) | Address `0x23` |

**Note:** On the pressure sensor, remove the 2 resistors on SDA and SCL because when too many sensors are placed in parallel, the value of these resistors drops too much.

**Note:** On the ANS160 sensor, cut the humidity sensor tracks to avoid conflict with the one on the BMP280 sensor (they are on the same address)

### Pulse / Interrupt Sensors

| Sensor Signal | ESP8266 Pin | Internal Pull-Up | Trigger Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rain Gauge Signal** | GPIO 14 (D5) | Yes (`INPUT_PULLUP`) | `FALLING` edge |
| **Anemometer Signal** | GPIO 12 (D6) | Yes (`INPUT_PULLUP`) | `FALLING` edge |

If you lose access to the web portal or misconfigure the network settings, you can wipe the internal NVS flash storage without reflashing firmware:

1. **Press and hold** the **FLASH button** (GPIO 0 / D3) on the NodeMCU board.
2. Hold it down for **10 continuous seconds**.
3. The onboard blue LED will flash rapidly and the console will output:
   `[System] Factory Reset triggered via FLASH button!`
4. All stored settings will be erased, and the ESP8266 will reboot automatically into Access Point captive portal mode (`WeatherStation_Setup`).

---

## 💾 Backup & Restore

### Downloading Backup
